Apps are sites which are collections ofmods and possibly some extra special code.

For instance hoe-house is a basic boot-str install plus the game hoe-house.

CD into the directory and MAKE to make, MAKE SERV to run locally and MAKE UPLOAD to upload to gae.

However before you can install them you will have to adjust the appid to one that you control.

Edit apps/*/html/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml to change this appid.
